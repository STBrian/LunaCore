# LunaCore
LunaCore is a work in progress Lua script loader for Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition, featuring an easy API interface to interact with the game. You can check api_docs.md for an introduction on basic usage of the API.

The plugin runs alongside the game thanks to Luma3DS plugin loader and is built using CTRPluginFramework which provides the essentials to work together with the game.

LunaCore is the result of fusing different community contributions into a single project. To know more about the contributions see the Credits section.
